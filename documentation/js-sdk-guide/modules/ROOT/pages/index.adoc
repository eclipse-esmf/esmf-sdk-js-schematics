= Introduction

The Javascript SDK (JS-SDK) offers libraries which help in the process of automated generation of Angular
components using an Aspect Model as input or to process an Aspect Model in frontend at runtime.

== SAMM Schematics
For generating UI components it uses schematics under the hood. Schematics is a template-based code generator that
supports complex logic. It is a set of instructions for transforming a software project by generating or modifying code.
Schematics is packaged into collections and can be installed with npm or yarn. Afterwards new components can be
easily created by running a command in the CLI and focusing on linking everything easily afterwards.

Examples: parent-child
communication, event emitters for customizing actions, passing data back and forth.

The SAMM schematics collection is a powerful tool for creating, modifying, and maintaining any software project. It is
particularly useful for customizing Angular projects or components to suit custom needs of any organization.


== Aspect Model Loader
The Aspect Model loader can be used to load an Aspect Model, to traverse and access the different information a
model provides (units, descriptions, constraints, etc.), and to implement generic frontends, which are capable to automatically
adapt to the underling Aspect Model. For example a new added property and the related value could be shown in the
UI including all information (name, description and unit) without changing any line of code.
