= Adding internationalization to the project

=== What does internationalization mean?
Internationalization is the process of supporting multiple languages in your applications.
This can be accomplished in an Angular application through third party libraries, such as ngx-translate, or you
can use the built-in i18n functionality.

The command explained below does all the necessary work to prepare the Angular application to support this feature
without any other requirements.

=== Adding internationalization to an Angular app using schematics

In the example, a brand-new application was generated using the command:

[source]
ng new app demo-schematics

NOTE: Before running any schematic command make sure you are in the Angular project folder with an `angular.json` configuration file.

In the demo-schematics project folder run:
[source]
ng generate @esmf/semantic-ui-schematics:i18n

Afterwards the project is ready to offer translated a UI using https://github.com/ngx-translate[ngx-translate].
