= Adding internationalization to the project

=== What does internationalization mean?
Internationalization is the process of supporting multiple languages in your applications.
This can be accomplished in an Angular application through third-party libraries, such as _ngx-translate_, or you
can use the built-in i18n functionality.

The command explained below does all the necessary work to prepare the Angular application to support this feature
without any other requirements.

=== Adding internationalization to an Angular app using schematics

Create a new Angular application using the command:

[source]
ng new app demo-schematics

NOTE: Before running any schematics command make sure you are in the Angular project folder with an `angular.json` configuration file.

In the `demo-schematics` project folder run:
[source]
ng generate @esmf/semantic-ui-schematics:i18n

Afterwards the project can translate a UI using https://github.com/ngx-translate[ngx-translate,window=_blank,opts=nofollow].
