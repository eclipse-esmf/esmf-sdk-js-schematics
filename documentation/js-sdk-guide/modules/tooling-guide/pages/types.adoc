= Generation interfaces derived from an Aspect Model

Dealing with an Aspect Model and generating components or other elements based on it, the type safety and definition must be ensured for a smooth development process.
Generating interfaces is included for each element derived from an Aspect Model.

The type generation functionality is provided through a schematics and can be used as follows:

[source]
ng generate @esmf/semantic-ui-schematics:types --aspectModelTFilesString=<relative-path-model-ttl>

or

[source]
ng g @esmf/semantic-ui-schematics:types --aspectModelTFilesString=<relative-path-model-ttl-1>,<relative-path-model-ttl-2>

Afterwards you can choose the Aspect Model and all referenced .ttl files to generate the desired interfaces.
The interfaces will be generated under `src/app/shared/types/<aspect-model-name>/<aspect-model-version>/<aspect-model-name>.types.ts`.

== Example using the Movement.ttl:

.Show stacktrace
[source,turtle]
----
include::example$Movement.ttl[]
----

Running the following CLI command.
Movement.ttl is stored in the root folder of the Angular project:

[source]
ng g @esmf/semantic-ui-schematics:types --aspectModelTFilesString=Movement.ttl

The following interfaces will be generated:

[source,typescript]
----
include::example$movement.types.ts[]
----
