= Form component generation

== _Detailed schema overview_

NOTE: Before generating a form component refer to the xref:internationalization.adoc[internationalization] file.

In the example, a brand-new application was generated using the command:

[source]
ng new app demo-schematics --no-standalone

A schematics will be generated using the following command:

[source]
ng generate [collection-name]:[schematics-name]

For demonstration purposes, the https://github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-aspect-model-editor/blob/main/core/apps/ame/src/assets/aspect-models/org.eclipse.examples/1.0.0/Movement.ttl[Movement.ttl,window=_blank,opts=nofollow] Aspect Model will be used.
Below is a detailed representation of the command-line interface steps which generates a form component using the Movement.ttl Aspect Model file by running the command.

NOTE: Before running any schematics commands make sure you are in the Angular project folder where you want to generate the new component.

Component generation is achieved by running either of the following commands:

[source]
ng generate @esmf/semantic-ui-schematics:form

[source]
ng g @esmf/semantic-ui-schematics:form

NOTE: The Angular folder where the component generation takes place should contain another folder with the .ttl files.

=== _Load pre-existing configuration file_

After going through the wizard at least once, a config file will be auto-generated.
The first prompt allows you to load a config file or start from scratch by loading one or multiple Aspect Model files.

image::config-file-loading.png[width=100%]

When you decide to create a new configuration file, you will be prompted to specify a name for your config file.
This provided name will be integrated into the default naming structure for the config file.

The naming structure is <config-file-name>-wizard.config.json.
Here, <config-file-name> is the name that you provide when prompted.

For example, if you enter myConfig when prompted for the config file name, your new config file will be named myConfig-wizard.config.json.

image::schema.enter-name-for-config-file.png[width=100%]

When you decide to load a pre-existing config file, the system will display the result as follows:

image::schema.load-config-file.yes.png[width=100%]

This will give access to the folder structure and by using a FUZZY search mechanism can provide the possibility to input the pre-existing config file.
The config file will now be named based on your input _<config-file-name>_-wizard.config.json, and can be found in the root folder of the project.

=== _Aspect Model selection_

If no pre-existing config file is loaded, then there is an option to choose for one or multiple Aspect Model files from the folder structure, using the same FUZZY search mechanism.

image::schema.aspect-model-selection.png[width=100%]

image::schema.another-aspect-model-selection.png[width=100%]

=== _Entity or specific aspect selection_

An Aspect or an Entity must be chosen in order for the form to be created.
This can be done in this step by choosing from a list.

image::schema.aspect-or-entity-selection-form.png[width=100%]

=== _Property exclusion_

Some properties may be omitted.
This can be done in the following step.

image::schema.exclude-properties.png[width=100%]

=== _Component path_

Once all the prompts are answered, a form will be generated based on the selected options.
The default path of the newly generated component is `*_src/app/shared/components/<component-name>_*`.

└─── components
        └─── <component-name>
        │    └───<form-field>
        │   │   │   <form-field-component-name>-form.component.html

        │   │   <component-name>-form.component.ts
        │   │   <component-name>-form.module.ts

=== _Multiple version support_

An Aspect Model can have multiple versions.
If this is the case, and you want to generate multiple components having different version, this can be done when this prompt question shows up:

image::multi-version-support.png[width=100%]

The folder structure will then change accordingly.

        └─── <component-version-0>

        │    │   │   <component-name>-form.module.ts

=== _Material theme(Indigo pink)_

User can add to angular.json Indigo pink material theme.
These action will appear in the actions column of the form.
In the following prompt you can choose to add the Indigo pink material theme.

image::material-theme-prompt.png[width=100%]

In the generated angular.json form if user selected yes we can observe the change in styles array.

=== _Set view encapsulation strategy for the generated form component_

User can set the View Encapsulation strategy by default the ViewEncapsulation will be set to None on the generated form component.
In the following prompt you can choose to add another View Encapsulation value.

image::view-encapsulation-prompt.png[width=100%]

=== _Generate read only form components_

Our tool allows users to effortlessly generate read-only forms.
This feature is particularly useful for creating display components where data modification is not required.

image::schema.read-only-forms.png[width=100%]

=== _Flags for generating the form_

By using

[source]
ng generate @esmf/semantic-ui-schematics:form --help

or

[source]
ng g @esmf/semantic-ui-schematics:form --help

you can get access to all the options encapsulated in the schema.json file.
Each field has a description for a better understanding of it and how to use it.
